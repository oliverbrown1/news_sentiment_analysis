This program also uses a section of the financial phrasebank from Malo, Pekka & Sinha, Ankur & Takala, Pyry & Korhonen, Pekka & Wallenius, Jyrki. (2013). FinancialPhraseBank-v1.0. For testing purposes only. 

With the following features:
  - Scrape a list of recent financial news from a list of trusted financial news sources
